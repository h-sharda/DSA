## Key Observations

### **Bubble Sort**

- **Inefficient**: The time complexity of O(n²) makes it impractical for large datasets.
- **Stable**: Because it swaps adjacent elements, it doesn't change the relative order of equal elements.
- **Best Use**: Typically used for **educational purposes** to introduce sorting algorithms.
- **Number of Operations**: High number of comparisons and swaps (O(n²)).

### **Selection Sort**

- **Inefficient**: Similar to Bubble Sort, it has O(n²) time complexity, which is inefficient for larger datasets.
- **Not Stable**: It selects the minimum element and swaps it with the current element, potentially disrupting the order of equal elements.
- **Best Use**: Can be useful when the number of writes is critical because it performs only O(3n) writes, making it advantageous in situations where swapping is costly.
- **Operations**: Performs fewer swaps (O(n)) but the number of comparisons is still O(n²).

### **Insertion Sort**

- **Efficient for Small or Nearly Sorted Datasets**: Insertion Sort excels in scenarios where the data is already partially sorted, making it much faster than O(n²) algorithms in these cases.
- **Stable**: It shifts elements to insert a value in the correct position, maintaining the relative order of equal elements.
- **Best Use**: Commonly used as a subroutine in hybrid algorithms like **Timsort** (which is used in Python's built-in sort).
- **Operations**: It performs fewer swaps (O(n²) in the worst case) but can perform very well for small or nearly sorted data.

### **Merge Sort**

- **Efficient for Large Datasets**: Merge Sort guarantees O(n log n) time complexity, making it highly suitable for large datasets.
- **Stable**: The algorithm's divide-and-conquer approach ensures stability.
- **Space Complexity**: Requires additional memory for the temporary arrays during the merging phase (O(n)).
- **Best Use**: Ideal for external sorting, where data cannot fit into memory, and when stability is important.
- **Operations**: The merge step involves copying elements into temporary arrays, which may make it less efficient in terms of writes.

### **Quick Sort**

- **Efficient in Practice**: Quick Sort is widely used due to its in-place nature and relatively fast performance.
- **Not Stable**: The swapping of elements based on partitioning can disrupt the relative order of equal elements.
- **Worst Case**: Quick Sort can degrade to O(n²) if the pivot selection is poor. However, this can be mitigated by using randomized pivot selection.
- **Best Use**: A **general-purpose sorting algorithm** known for its efficiency on average, especially when used with randomized pivot selection.
- **Operations**: The partitioning phase involves moderate writes and recursive calls.
